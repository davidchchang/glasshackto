Nascent Digital hacks Google Glass at #GlassHackTO.

Concept: Green P Finder
=======================

Using [Green P Parking](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=b0993228eb22a310VgnVCM1000003dd60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=1a66e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD) open data provided by the City of Toronto, we will implement a Google Glass app that will search for the closest Green P parking lot and provide directions via the [Google Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/).

Improvements
------------

Future improvements include:

* Searching for the nearest parking lot within a specific price range.
* Remembering where you parked and provide walking directions back to your car.
